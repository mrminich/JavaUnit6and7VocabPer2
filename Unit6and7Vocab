Period 2
Units 6 & 7

Unit 6
1. cohesive - When a class is cohesive, it has both pubilic methods and constants are related ot the the main purpose of the class. Cohesive classes are used when a class is set up with code that is related to that class only, and runs without any problems.
2. coupling - When a class has a "has-a" relationship, it is considered coupled. It is best to make a class that has no coupling.
3. composition - 
4. has-a relationship - A class has a "has-a" relationship with another class is an object of that class is an intstance variable of the class. "Has-a" relationships are shown in use when you make an object of one class an instance variable in another class.
5. precondition - A precondition is something that is guaranteed by the creator of a program. A percondition is important to a program because it is what is guaranteed to work in the progran by the creator.
6. postcondition
7. static field -dfdjfdkljfdkljfdkljfkldf
8. static method
9. instance method
10. class invariant
11. scope of a variable - The scope of a variable is the area of a program in which the variable can be used without causing an error. The scope of a variable is limited to where the variable was declared, referring to them as global or local.
12. shadowing - Shadowing is when a local variable is given the same name as an instance variable. This is does not cause an error but is confusing for the coder.
13. toString method - The purpose of the toString method is to allow a client programmer to display the state of an object. This method is not very organized and is usually used to make sure there are no errors in the code.
14. local variable - A local vairable is a variable that can only be used in the method of a class that it was initialized in. Local variables are initialized in the method of a class while instance variables are initialized in the class. 

Unit 7
1. ArrayList - An array list is an object that can store multiple objects, functioning like a background array. ArrayLists are instantiated at 0 and grows according to the objects needed to be stored in it, doubling in size to accomodate the obejcts.
2. size method
3. get method
4. the overloaded add method
5. remove method
6. key
7. flag variable - The data type of a flag variable is usually boolean. Flag variables are often used with while loops.
